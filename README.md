# Pac-Man Java Game

A simple implementation of the classic Pac-Man game using Java's AWT and Swing libraries. The game includes core mechanics such as player movement, ghost behavior, scoring, and level progression.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Play as Pac-Man, navigating mazes, eating pellets, and avoiding ghosts.
- **Tile-Based Maze**: The maze is represented as a grid, with walls, pellets, and power-ups.
- **Ghost Behavior**: The game includes four ghosts, each with a predefined movement pattern, providing a challenging experience.
- **Scoring**: Players accumulate points by eating pellets and avoiding ghost captures.
- **Power-Ups**: Includes special power pellets that temporarily turn the ghosts blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for additional points.
- **Multiple Levels**: Players can progress through levels, each with an increasingly complex maze layout and faster ghosts.

## Installation

How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man around the maze.
